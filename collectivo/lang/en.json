This means that an amount of 15% of the maximum number of the total nominal value of the shares may not be exceeded at the end of the previous financial year. The payment of further shares will be postponed to the following year or years. The exit date determines the order. If the company's share capital has been partially used up at this point in time due to an accumulated loss, the payment will only be made in proportion to the remaining unused company share capital. If the cooperative's equity capital is negative at this point (Section 225 Paragraph 1 UGB), the payment will only be made when the cooperative's equity capital is positive again.",
  "t:mila_form_final3": "You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving reasons. The deadline is 14 days from the delivery of the acceptance of the membership by the board of the cooperative."
